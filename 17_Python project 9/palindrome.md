# Scenario: Palindrome Detector 

Create a Python code that determines whether a given word or phrase is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. For example KAYAK.

# Instructions:

## Step 1. Implement a function `is_palindrome` that checks if a string is a palindrome.

In that function, use:

- ***word.split()***: Removes spaces for phrases like "race car".

- ***join()***: Joins the split components to create a continuous string without spaces.

- ***.lower()***: Converts the word to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.

- ***[::-1]***: Reverses the string to compare it with the original.

## Step 2. Test the function with various words and phrases.

Use these words  civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak, race car and hello for the test.

## Step 3. Analyze the results and note any observations.

Execute the file palindrome.py
